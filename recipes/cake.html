        <p>The picture may be lying about it being a chocolate cake but we are going to make a vanilla cake. </p>
        <p>In order to make such a dish, you will need patience and love!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>Plain or all purpose flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Milk, full fat</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the eggs with sugar for a whole 7 minutes until thick and glossy, it changes from yellow to white, and tripled in volume (just over double depth in the bowl).</li>
                <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Then add into egg mixture in 3 lots, mixing for just 5 seconds on Speed 1 in between. This should make the flour just incorporated – don’t worry if there are some bits not mixed in.</li>
                <li>use a microwave or stove to heat milk with the butter until it melts.</li>
                <li>Mix some batter into hot milk.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour milk mixture back inot whipped eggs over 20 seconds on Speed 1. Scrape down sides of bowls, then mix for 10 seconds on Speed 1 – the batter should now be smooth;.</li>
                <li>Pour into 2 cake pans lined with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Knock out big air bubbles.</li>
                <li>Bake 30 minutes til golden brown.</li>
                <li>Cool upside down.</li>
                
            </ol>
